# beeflex-consultancy-website

## Description
Beeflex consuting website is a basic website for a consultancy firm that wants to launch her operations and carry out some services such as leadership training, goal mapping training etc. It was built for a client while I was still a student with Microverse. Beeflex consulting website was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I personally did the designs on figma which was approved by the client. Find the mobile and destop designs below:
